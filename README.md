A tool to switch Advanced Power Managment(APM) level from lowest power consumption to maximum perfomance.


Usage
--------

Just run it, but you may require admin rights(win 7 >) to do that. Unfortunately after a power-of, reset or a hardware reset, 
the settings will back to default vendor specific values. So you  may want to add it to Windows startup.
